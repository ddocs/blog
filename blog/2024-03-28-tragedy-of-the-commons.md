Recently, I found myself waking up bolt upright and surprisingly alert at 3am. I turned on my laptop to check my email and before I knew it I was learning all about a remarkable female Nobel prize winning economist called [**Elinor Ostrom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom). 

I'm surprised to have not heard her name more widely mentioned because her research is so hopeful, pertinent and pragmatic to the biggest challenges we are facing today - [**The Climate Crisis**](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/climate-change/solutions-climate-change/). 

In a nutshell, Elinor Ostrom found numerous case studies of groups compelled to share natural resources like pastures, fishing waters, grazing land and forests. Her field based research effectively disproved the prevailing assumptions of economists that collectively used natural resources would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term - the so called ['**Tragedy of the Commons**'].

Wonderfully, Elinor found instead that groups and communities found ways to **share natural resources for the benefit of all** and in a way that **promoted their longevity**. The way these communities were able to do so was by **collaborating and cooperating**. Over time, communities developed self-governing rules that promoted economic and ecological sustainability.

The Tragedy of the Commons refers to a situation in which individuals with access to a public resource (a common) act in their own interest and, in doing so, ultimately deplete the resource. It assumes a somewhat dispiriting stance about people. The reality is more complex. The unquestioned dominance of this perspective has led to a situation where in the UK, the majority of our beautiful countryside is out of bounds for most of the population. **92% of the countryside has no right to roam and 97% of rivers have no uncontested rights of navigation**. 

Interestingly, Elinor also found field based cases that supported the Tragedy of the Commons view. These were situations characterised by **short term thinking**, an **absence of communication** between groups, a **lack of trust** for each other and no reliable access to **external enforcement** e.g. legal redress.
 


Olson's logic of collective action contains similar bleak expectations of human nature. It is worth noting that Hardin and Olson were themselves restricted by their gender, socioeconomic status and geography. i.e. white european men. Why is this of relevance? Ask any breastfeeding mother or anyone who has children: What is your expected return on this investment? Is there anything 'rational' about having a child? It wrecks women's careers, bodies and finances - apparently it costs £100,000 to rear a single human to adulthood. 

Elinor Ostrom challenged the Tragedy of the Commons argument with solid field based evidence.
