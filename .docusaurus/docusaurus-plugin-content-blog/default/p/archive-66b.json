A fascinating array of solutions drives the expansion of chains and projects. \n\n<!---truncate-->\n\nEssentially, there are three key properties that a blockchain system needs to balance; but achieving all three attributes is a challenge that eludes most blockchain systems resulting in tradeoffs and potential loss of real world applicability.\n\n<img src={require('@site/static/img/scalability-trilemma.png').default} alt='Scalability Trilemma' />\n\nThe three properties are:\n\n**Scalability**: The chain can process more transactions than a regular node can verify.\n\n**Decentralization**: The chain can run without any trust dependencies on a small group of large centralized actors. This is typically interpreted to mean that there should not be any trust (or even honest-majority assumption) of a set of nodes that you cannot join with just a consumer laptop.\n\n**Security**: The chain can resist a large percentage of participating nodes trying to attack it (ideally 50%; anything above 25% is fine, 5% is definitely not fine).\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe pioneer blockchain designs of Bitcoin and Ethereum prioritised decentralization and security leading to troublesome scalability issues as popularity increased. Gas and transaction fees reached formidable heights and led to virtual unusability in 2018 with transactions per second unable to come anywhere close to meeting demand. \n\nScalability challenges include transaction throughput, latency, storage demands and consensus mechanisms are critical factors impacting scalability. \n\nSecurity vulnerabilities include 51% attacks, smart contract flaws and single points of failure through the backdoor like the reliability of AWS for running a node yet also inviting centralization and vulnerability to an outage. \n\nDecentralization challenges include how difficult this is to enable in real-life. For instance how to manage enterprise performance expectations \n\n## The Solutions\n\n### On Chain and Off Chain \nOC Sharding, SegWit, block size adjustments\n\nOff Chain - Lightning network.  and consensus mechanisms\n\n#### Sharding\nSharding divides the blockchain into parallel chains. \nSharding techniques partition blockchain networks into parallel processing units to enhance throughput whilst preserving decentralization. \n\nChallenges are \n\n1. Scaling Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus protocols. Scaling needs to work across the three phases of practical Byzantine fault tolerance. Pre-prepare, Prepare and Commit. \n\n2. Ensuring secure and efficient shard formation \n\n3. Enabling secure distributed transactions even with malicious coordinators. \n\nAdditionally, how are transaction shards agreed?\n\nHow is final consensus achieved to aggregate shards into a single blockchain update?\n\nIt has been successful as a solution but not without downsides. \nWhile sharding improves scalability, it introduces cross-shard latency and reduces per-shard decentralization. \n\nWith architectural innovations like ELASTICO, can sharding achieve linear throughput scaling without compromising byzantine fault tolerance?\n\nWith TEE-Sharding, can trusted hardware enable secure cross-shard transactions in permissioned environments. \n\n#### Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups)\n\n#### State Channels\n\n#### Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS)\n\n#### Federated Blockchains\n\nSome approaches, like sharding (dividing the blockchain into parallel chains) and layer-2 protocols (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-rollups), state channels), have shown measurable success. Others, such as delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) [7] or federated blockchains [8], achieve scalability but at the cost of reduced decentralization—a trade-off that remains controversial among blockchain purists. As blockchain adoption grows, the trilemma’s implications extend beyond academic debate into real-world usability."},{"id":"what-do-we-mean-by-trust","metadata":{"permalink":"/what-do-we-mean-by-trust","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-24-what-do-we-mean-by-trust.md","title":"Can we really trust in crypto software?","description":"What do we mean by Trust and Trustlessness?

Are these concepts relevant when systems are created and run by flawed humans. \n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## Mental models \nAlthough software components can be labeled as 'trusted', trustworthiness is not a black-and-white issue. It is meaningless without answers to the questions, “Trusted by whom?” and “Trusted to do what?” Similarly, we cannot define security policies without asking, “Secure from whom?” and “Secure against what?”. This specificity is important. \n\nAttempting to classify all programs as simply trusted or untrusted is not always helpful, yet some security experts continue to think along such lines. The missing component in this common and dangerous oversimplification is the mental model. Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford wrote that “a computer is secure if you can depend on it and its software to behave as you expect.”\n\nFulfilling expectations is a matter of keeping behaviour and expectations in agreement, and the users’ expectations are based on their mental model of the system. Both the security policy and mental model are dynamic; they change in response to user actions.\n\nThe lure of decentralised finance or the Defi movement has been enabled by blockchain and distributed ledger technologies that distribute trust evenly across a network. The Blockchain has changed the landscape of economic interactions by allowing people to place trust in abstract concepts rather than institutions or other third parties.\n\nHowever, the current debate on centralisation versus decentralisation often overlooks the complexity of the socio-technical ecology we inhabit, and the significance of human behaviour."},{"id":"elinor-ostrom","metadata":{"permalink":"/elinor-ostrom","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-28-tragedy-of-the-commons.md","title":"How this Nobel Prize winning Economist might save the world?","description":"commons","date":"2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"self-governance","permalink":"/tags/self-governance"},{"inline":true,"label":"economics","permalink":"/tags/economics"}],"readingTime":2.27,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anita","title":"Chief","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"elinor-ostrom","title":"How this Nobel Prize winning Economist might save the world?","authors":{"name":"Anita","title":"Chief"},"tags":["self-governance","economics"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Can we really trust in crypto software?","permalink":"/what-do-we-mean-by-trust"}},"content":"![commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Medieval_Open_Field_System.JPG)\n\nRecently, I found myself waking up bolt upright and surprisingly alert at 3am. I turned on my laptop to check my email and before I knew it I was learning all about a remarkable female Nobel prize winning economist called [**Elinor Ostrom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom). \n\nI'm surprised to have not heard her name more widely mentioned because her research is so hopeful, pertinent and pragmatic to the biggest challenges we are facing today - [**The Climate Crisis**](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/climate-change/solutions-climate-change/). \n\nIn a nutshell, Elinor Ostrom found numerous case studies of groups compelled to share natural resources like pastures, fishing waters, grazing land and forests. Her field based research effectively disproved the prevailing assumptions of economists that collectively used natural resources would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term - the so called ['**Tragedy of the Commons**'].\n\nWonderfully, Elinor found instead that groups and communities found ways to **share natural resources for the benefit of all** and in a way that **promoted their longevity**. The way these communities were able to do so was by **collaborating and cooperating**. Over time, communities developed self-governing rules that promoted economic and ecological sustainability. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.aapss.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/elinor-ostrom.png\" width=\"200\" />\n\n\nThe Tragedy of the Commons refers to a situation in which individuals with access to a public resource (a common) act in their own interest and, in doing so, ultimately deplete the resource. It assumes a somewhat dispiriting stance about people. The reality is more complex. The unquestioned dominance of this perspective has led to a situation where in the UK, the majority of our beautiful countryside is out of bounds for most of the population. **92% of the countryside has no right to roam and 97% of rivers have no uncontested rights of navigation**. \n\nInterestingly, Elinor also found field based cases that supported the Tragedy of the Commons view. These were situations characterised by **short term thinking**, an **absence of communication** between groups, a **lack of trust** for each other and no reliable access to **external enforcement** e.g. legal redress.\n \n\n\nOlson's logic of collective action contains similar bleak expectations of human nature. It is worth noting that Hardin and Olson were themselves restricted by their gender, socioeconomic status and geography. i.e. white european men. Why is this of relevance? Ask any breastfeeding mother or anyone who has children: What is your expected return on this investment? Is there anything 'rational' about having a child? It wrecks women's careers, bodies and finances - apparently it costs £100,000 to rear a single human to adulthood. \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the Tragedy of the Commons argument with solid field based evidence."}]}}
