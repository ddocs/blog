title: Developer Experience (DX), Relations and Marketing

---

Developer Relations is a blend between customer success and product. It encompasses developer education, marketing, developer experience and developer success. However, typically people who are great at marketing and social media don't have strong technical skills and vice versa. 

Finding smart, technically adept people to talk about technology authoritatively is crucial for the success of a project. The impact of using the wrong terminology can be devastating for a company's reputation. 

The key goal is to create **awareness**, **engage**, **inform** and **enable** developers at all stages of the developer journey. 

From a technical writing perspective, usually the docs are designed to meet the needs of developers or another specialist technical audience. 

## 🚀 Developer relations in Web3 

It's so important to have a feedback loop going in Web3. Not just letting the community know what new features are coming out but also advocating for their requirements to the product teams. 

## 🌀 Growing the developer community

Helping to create and grow the developer community is central to developer relations in web3.

Often, this means going to meetups, events, gatherings, conferences and just talking about the project or doing demos of cool stuff that is possible. 
It also means being a regular part of discord groups and coffee times. Being a part of explaining new content and documentation  - especially tutorials. 

It's a real win for everybody as enthusiasm for a project can snowball. Inhabiting these spaces is a great way to collect feedback, work alongside ambassadors to create demos and code examples, or find solutions to product issues and product bugs. 

## 🔊 Social media

Broadcasting about your project on Twitter is arguably a popular social medium for promoting web3 projects with Discord being a place to chat and meet. Telegram is an increasingly important medium for communication.

Engaging with developers and creating engaging, useful resources such as demos, code samples, documentation, how-to guides, and blog posts has a huge overlap with technical writing.
