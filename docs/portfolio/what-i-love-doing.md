title: What I Love Doing

---

I am greedy. I want to know stuff. I pursue knowledge for its own sake. I can become quite enthralled by a new topic, bore people to death talking about it and then discover something else to be fascinated by and repeat. It's probably why I prefer writing. 

I get a kick out of learning about how things work, why they are the way they are. I also like being proved wrong and made to rethink something. I like the blankness I experience in my mind when I have to let go of something I was true.

Most of all, I love the process of trying to understand something complex, thinking I'll never understand it and then the joyful feeling when it all just clicks.

I think it's important to stay up to date with changes and emerging trends in technology and technical writing. For this I like to stay close to tech communities in the web dev, tech writing and developer relations space and try to talk to people. 

The interesting thing about tech is how things are always changing and evolving. It's more and more pervasive and more than a little bit invasive now. But it's always fresh and challenging and inviting of new perspectives. I get excited about the things that I think are solving problems. Big, thorny problems. I think they will defeat me with their complexity but actually they don't.
