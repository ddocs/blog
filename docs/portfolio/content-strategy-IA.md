## Content Strategy & Information Architecture

The aim of this project was to provide a holistic technical communication solution for Hotels.com Platform Engineering teams.

This included evaluating the existing documentation state against key strategic objectives, user and stakeholder interests. Defining a desirable end state and creating a path to achieve a successful end-state.

Defining a Content Strategy in harmony with the needs of the audience and designing an extendable Information Architecture were key aspects of this project.
