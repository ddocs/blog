APIs are not just tools for integration. With the growth of microservices they are strategic assets that can significantly enhance the functionality and offering of a business or service. Great API docs should showcase the ease and effortlessness of your API service.  

## Cudos - Web3 Crypto

This project was for Cudos - a decentralized computation solution for Web3.

The aim was to promote developer onboarding and get people building on the Cudos chain. Alongside tutorials and explainers was an API Reference built using redoc.ly that consumed an OpenAPI.yml file and rendered it beautifully.

## Onfido - Fintech

This project was for Onfido - an Identity Verification company.

The aim was to provide a smooth developer experience using the Onfido API and to showcase its ease of use and effortless integration capabilities.

Empathy for the target audience is crucial for gauging how easy an API is to use.

I began by testing the API as if I was a developer looking to perform biometric and documentation checks. I used any existing documentation to make requests on Postman and carefully noted my steps including any pain-points or areas of confusion I encountered.

Next, I interviewed Product Managers, Support Leads and Solutions Engineers to get their input on pain-points and wish lists. I then analysed examples of best practice API docs relevant to this space e.g. Stripe and Twilio. I also analysed competitor documentation to define cognitive models on structuring the docs and any good ideas that we could implement ourselves.

I drew from the 3:30:3 rule – 3 seconds to understand the API, 30 seconds to find the endpoint, 3 minutes to be up and running.From this, I compiled a list of recommendations and actions and agreed on the way forward with the team.

Key Use Case scenarios were identified and Quick Starts created to match these.

Complex processes and/or use of contradictory terminology was simplified with graphics. Flow diagrams were used to provide an overview and quick grasp of the domain.

A new API Reference taxonomy was created and content redesigned to correlate with key user journeys.

Comprehensive but concise instructions accompanied code samples to get developers up and running in the quickest time possible.

### KEY OUTCOMES:
1. Feedback from new clients was positive. They were impressed with the Onfido API and its ease of use.
2. 95% Positive feedback was gathered from simple Hotjar analytics with a measurable decline in API usage support tickets. It was also useful to set up a mechanism for ongoing improvements.

## Qredo - Web3 Crypto

This project was for Qredo - A Distributed Multi-Party Computation network and platform for securing Digital Assets.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/Qredo-API.png').default} alt='Qredo API' />

Creating the API docs was one facet of a very broad role that encompassed content, documentation and setting up processes and workflows.

The aim was to allow partners to integrate with the Qredo API as easily as possible. The target audience was international teams of developers based at Hedge Funds and other Financial Institutions.

The API was still being developed with new endpoints being added, so a key part of the process was ensuring close communication with the engineering lead and being part of conversations with clients in meetings and in comms channels to track queries and identify onboarding challenges as well as other useful feedback. This feedback could be about product expectations or confusion to do with a particular stage of the integration.

This feedback was then added to a tracker where it could be prioritised and/or allocated as something to discuss with the product team or a usability issue that could be resolved with better docs. It was also important to keep track of naming to ensure consistent terminology at API design/code and documentation.

It was rewarding to be a part of the end-to-end flow and customer experience. 

### KEY OUTCOMES:

1. Ongoing feedback loops from customers led to dynamic, swift and responsive updates to the docs.
2. Alignment of workflows and establishing good communications between product, sales and engineering all contributed to excellent docs and Qredo’s success.
The API reference guide is a comprehensive resource of all endpoints The reference guide is the source of truth that developers return to whenever there’s a serious issue or question about an API’s functioning, and therefore must be painstakingly managed.
