## Who am I?

I am inquisitive....
I want to learn and know stuff. 
Then I want to know more...

I also love solving problems...maybe not love; but it's what the thinking part of the body is evolved for. How do I get away from this sabre toothed tiger? How do I make integrating with this API more intuitive? How do I talk about this complex, abstract invisible thing to my target audience so that they want to use it? My mind is best applied to real world problems that can be worked on in the here and now. 

I love tech because it's constantly evolving and changing right before my eyes. Delighting, alarming and amazing me. It's impossible to get bored of.  

The power has truly shifted from traditional industries like finance and law to the geeks, nerds and misfits in technology where all can be embraced. It's a shift with a low bar to entry - apart from the ability to learn and acquire expertise of course. But this is a blessed time in our history where an industry shares its knowledge and information freely on the internet. There are few gatekeepers. 

I have an enthusiastic approach to coding and scripting but I am NOT a developer. 
I did not sit in my room glued to a keyboard from the age of 7. I was outside on my bike playing with my friends. (I did a very tiny amount of coding too).
However, I do alternate between periods of relative solitude - when I prefer my laptop to people and do deep learning. Then there are the times when I prefer people to my laptop and am more ultra sociable. 

## What do I enjoy doing

Currently, I'm interested in health technology, security, crypto, web3, cool ideas. 

I enjoyed working in cybersecurity and was keen to understand more about AI. For this reason, I chose to work for Darktrace - the original pioneers of artificial intelligence in security. Their approach is like nobody else and is the only way that makes sense to defeat zero day attacks. 

I probably do best in a more transparent workplace where knowledge sharing and openness is valued. 
Before that I worked for a few blockchain crypto companies including Ankr in San Francisco. 

Prior to that I worked at Expedia with the Hotels.com Platform team.

## How I work

Typically, I analyse and evaluate your current documentation status, I do a documentation audit, interview stakeholders and end-users, investigate information seeking behaviour and create a solution that fits your specific needs.

This can include: 
- Creating docs standards including the use of a style guide,
- Embedding a style guide and best practices into templates and the authoring workflow
- Recommending and implementing a new documentation tool, 
- Building a docs system,
- Devising comprehensive writing training, 
- Reviewing and restructuring existing documentation 
and creating documentation that is concise, clear and empathic to the needs of your intended audience.  

## Technical content with a human focus

There is often a gap between the language used by creators of technology and the end users who need to engage with it. This 'curse of knowledge' can be an obstacle to enabling adoption and user competence. 

As a documentarian, I act as an advocate for the end user to try and ensure frictionless comprehension and successful adoption.

Ideally, thought should go into understanding how to create docs that the intended audience want to consume. Thinking about the visual design as well as the language and terminology used. 

This gap between technology, business objectives and users is one that I inhabit. 

## Expertly tailored by design

Understanding the target audience whether they are end users, developers or decision makers is paramount to creating lucid content that engages and informs.

Fusing skills in information technology, development and user experience, I am uniquely placed to meet your documentation needs.
