Often, I need to evaluate tech writing tools. Every tech writer has their favourite.

My faves are [Docusaurus](docusaurus.io) - static site generator created by Facebook. Very easy to get started writing.

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is a great linting tool to implement and maintain a style guide. 

Useful [Web style guide resource](https://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/index.html) for planning taxonomies and information architecture.

Don't bother writing your own style guide. Take the best of Microsoft Manual of Style and Google Style Guide.
