The Prisoners dilemma game is conceptualised as a non-cooperative game where all players have complete information. There is no communication.

It encapsulates the 'tragedy of the commons' assumption that people are self-interested. 

"Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit - in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons." (Hardin 1968)


So the players in the game are herders using a common grazing meadow. There is a maximum limit to the number of animals that can be grazed on the meadow and be well fed. This is 'x'.

In a two-person game, the *cooperate* strategy would be to equally share the land with an equal number of cattle grazing. This would be x/2 animals for each herder. 

The *defect* strategy would be for each herder to graze as many animals as possible that could then be sold at profit. This number would be > x/2

Our herders are Sam and Joe. 

The game part plays out as follows:

|Sam | Joe | Outcome |
|----|-----|---------|
|defect | defect| nil profit|
|defect | cooperate | Sam gets 11 units of profit, Joe gets -1 |
|cooperate | defect| Joe gets 11 units of profit, Sam gets -1 |
|cooperate (x/2) | Both get 10 units of profit|

In this game, the best option for each herder is to maximise their cattle grazing and screw the other herder. This way, the most time you do is 2 years.
