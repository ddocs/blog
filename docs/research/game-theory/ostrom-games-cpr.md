Elinor Ostrom took game theory models, combined them with her Institutional Analysis and Development framework before adding 500g of her bounded rationality enforcement.

How are the rules enforced. Interestingly, they aren't enforced by anything intrinsic to the game, so Elinor talks about the need for external enforcement of rules. Whilst it is nice to imagine people play fairly, there need to be ways to address non-cooperative game playing.
